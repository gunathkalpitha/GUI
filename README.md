Hotel  Reservation System

The Hotel Reservation System allows customers to:
•View available rooms for specific dates.
•	Book rooms based on availability.
•	Modify or cancel existing reservations.

The hotel staff (administrator) can:
•	Manage room availability.
•	View all bookings and reservations.
•	Manage guest information.
•	Generate booking reports and check-in/check-out details.

This platform enables customers to register, log in, view available rooms for specific dates, book rooms based on availability, and modify or cancel existing reservations through a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and a JSON REST API. Administrators can manage room availability, view all bookings and reservations, handle guest information, generate booking reports, process check-in/check-out details, and manage staff information. Additionally, the system includes a desktop GUI application with database connectivity for CRUD operations, developed using C# and integrated with a JSON REST API.
